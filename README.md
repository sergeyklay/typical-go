# Typical Go

Build Automation Tool For Golang
- Alternative for [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) (a.k.a makefile)
- Framework-based Build Tool (No DSL)
- Supporting Java-like annotation for code generation

## Install

```
$ go get -u github.com/typical-go/typical-go
```

## Setup

Setup a new project
```bash
$ typical-go setup -new -go-mod -project-pkg=github.com/typical-go/typical-go/my-project
```
- `-new` generate simple app and typical-build source
- `-go-mod` initiate go.mod
- `-project-pkg` name of project package


## Run 

It is recommended to run via wrapper [`typicalw`](typicalw) 
```bash
$ ./typicalw
```

If the wrapper is missing, you can generate it using `setup` command
```bash
$ typical-go setup
```

## Typical-Build

Typical-Build contain project descriptor and the build logic. By default, it is located in [`tools/typical-build`](tools/typical-build/typical-build.go) and can be changed in wrapper script.

```go
package main

import (
   "fmt"

   "github.com/typical-go/typical-go/pkg/typgo"
)

var descriptor = typgo.Descriptor{
   ProjectName:    "custom-command",
   ProjectVersion: "1.0.0",

   Cmds: []typgo.Cmd{
      // compile
      &typgo.CompileProject{},
      // run
      &typgo.RunCmd{
         Before: typgo.BuildCmdRuns{"compile"},
         Action: &typgo.RunProject{},
      },
      // ping
      &typgo.Command{
         Name: "ping",
         Action: typgo.NewAction(
            func(c *typgo.Context) error {
               fmt.Println("pong")
               return nil
            },
         ),
      },
   },
}

func main() {
   typgo.Start(&descriptor)
}
```

## Typical-Tmp

Typical-Tmp is temporary folder that contain downloaded file and other build-mechanism. By default, it is located in `.typical-tmp` and can be changed in wrapper script.

## Annotation

Typical-Go support java-like annotation (except the parameter in [StructTag](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-struct-tags-in-go) format) for code-generation purpose. [Learn more](pkg/typast)

```go
// @mytag (key1:"val1" key2:"val2")
func myFunc(){
}
```

## Examples

Typical-Go using itself as build-tool which is an excellent example. For other examples:
- [x] [hello-world](https://github.com/typical-go/typical-go/tree/master/examples/hello-world)
- [x] [typapp sample](https://github.com/typical-go/typical-go/tree/master/examples/typapp-sample)
- [x] [typmock sample](https://github.com/typical-go/typical-go/tree/master/examples/typmock-sample)
- [x] [custom build-tool](https://github.com/typical-go/typical-go/tree/master/examples/custom-build-tool)
- [x] [custom command](https://github.com/typical-go/typical-go/tree/master/examples/custom-command)
